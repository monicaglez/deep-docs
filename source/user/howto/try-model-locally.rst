*******************
Try a model locally
*******************


1. Get Docker
-------------

The first step is having `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ installed. To have an up-to-date installation please follow
the `official Docker installation guide <https://docs.docker.com/install>`_.


2. Search for a model in the marketplace
----------------------------------------

The next step is to look for a model 
in the `DEEP Open Catalog marketplace <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/>`_
you want to try locally.  
The marketplace contains an extensible list of existing models e.g. 
	`DEEP OC Image Classification <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-image-classification-tensorflow.html>`_,
	`DEEP OC Retinopathy <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-retinopathy.html>`_,
	`DEEP OC Massive Online Data Streams <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-massive-online-data-streams.html>`_,
	`DEEP OC Seed Classification <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-seed-classification-theano.html>`_,
	`DEEP OC Phytopankton (Theano) <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-phytopankton-theano.html>`_,
	`DEEP OC Conus Classification <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-conus-classification-theano.html>`_, 
	`DEEP OC dogs breed determination <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-dogs-breed-determination.html>`_, 
	and many more.
	

3. Get the model
----------------

You will find that each model has an associate Docker container in DockerHub
	`DEEP OC Image Classification <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-image-classification-tensorflow.html>`_
	is associated with `deephdc/deep-oc-image-classification-tf <https://hub.docker.com/r/deephdc/deep-oc-image-classification-tf>`_,
	`DEEP OC Massive Online Data Streams <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/models/deep-oc-massive-online-data-streams.html>`_
	is associated with `deephdc/deep-oc-mods <https://hub.docker.com/r/deephdc/deep-oc-mods>`_, etc.

Let call the model you selected ``deep-oc-model_of_interest``. 
Please, download the container with:

::

    $ docker pull deephdc/deep-oc-model_of_interest
    

4. Run the model
----------------

Run the container with:
::

	$ docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 deephdc/deep-oc-model_of_interest
	

5. Go to the API, get the results
---------------------------------

Once running, point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>`_ 
and you will see the API documentation, 
where you can test the model functionality, as well as perform other actions.

All models in the `DEEP Open Catalog marketplace <https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/>`_
utilize `DEEPaaS API <https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS>`_.
The API enables a user friendly interaction with the underlying Deep Learning models and 
can be used both for training and inference with the models.

The concrete results can vary from model to model e.g. 
the results of ``deephdc/deep-oc-image-classification-tf`` are image type(s) and picture(s),
the results of ``deephdc/deep-oc-mods`` are predicted values (float numbers).
